## Main features of latest v5 HW are:

- LPC memory read (can be disabled),LPC Firmware Hub memory read and IO write for POST Code capture (and display on LED segments)
- POST code peek mode (LPC reads from dongle are disabled)
- POST code logger (sends all postcodes to USB serial port as hexadecimal bytes in ASCII)

This is hardware project for existing USB dongle board (costing about 150 EUR you should check from sales(at)artecgroup.com).
Using it for LPC dongle.

## IP cores

- LPC slave (supporting IO write, Memory read and LPC Firmware Hub read from device ID 0x0000)
- Flash Waveform generator
- FTDI parallel interface to onboard flash (supports 32 byte block write and 64K block read)
- FTDI parallel interface to convert and send bytes as hex codes in ASCII
- Scanning LED segment display coder

## Status
- HW cvs tag HWVersion_1_0 released (HW code 3)
- Software cvs tag SoftVersion_1_1 released (dongle.py script version 1.1)
- HW/Software bundle cvs tag version_1_4 released (bug fixes and added LPC Firmware hub [FWH] read). Contains HW version code 4 and dongle.py script version 2.0
- HW/Software bundle cvs tag version_1_5 released (Added Post code logger hardware, fast block read hardware and fast read flow control hardware. Updated software to support all the new hardware and older HW in legacy mode). Contains HW version code 5 and dongle.py script version 2.5
